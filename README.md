# Blossom — Productivity + Focus + Virtual Pet (Desktop App + FastAPI Backend)

Blossom is a desktop productivity application combining a task manager, focus timer, and a virtual pet system. It includes full authentication using JWT and a deployed FastAPI backend where users can test the API.

## Features

### 1. Task Manager
- Add tasks with priority levels
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Tasks are stored locally in the GUI
- Completing tasks grants XP used in the virtual pet system

### 2. Focus Timer (Gamification)
- Supports 25, 45, and 60-minute focus sessions
- Completely frontend-based
- Does not award XP
- Designed to support productivity through gamification

### 3. Virtual Pet System (Gamification)
- Adopt pets
- Manually feed your pet
- Feeding requires XP earned from completing tasks
- Hunger increases automatically with time
- Feeding decreases hunger
- If the pet stays unfed for 7 days, it dies
- Switch between multiple adopted pets

### 4. Growth Analytics
- Tracks total completed tasks
- Tracks user streaks

### 5. Authentication (JWT-Based)
- User signup
- Login
- Email verification
- Forgot-password (OTP)
- Password reset
- JWT-protected routes
- GUI communicates with the backend via JWT authentication

## Technology Stack

### GUI (Desktop Frontend)
- Python Tkinter
- Local JSON storage
- Requests library for API communication

### Backend
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- JWT authentication
- SQLite database
- Pydantic models
- CORS enabled
- Deployed on Render

**Note:**  
The directories `blossom_fe_plain` & `blossom_frontend` are early attempts at a web frontend. They are inactive but intentionally kept for anyone who wants to build a web-based UI using the existing backend.
